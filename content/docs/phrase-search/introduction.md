## Building a Search Engine: Introduction

### How to build phrase search engine using Elasticsearch?

While building a search engine for your e-commerce app, user data, or any structured data set many times you need to match all the query terms in their relative position. This is the case where entities like "quick brown dog", where the three terms individually don’t convey the same meaning as the three of them concatenated in this order.

In this chapter we’re going to build phrase search engine using Hackernews dataset.

We will use [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch) as our search engine and the index (and dataset) is hosted on an [appbase.io](https://appbase.io) app.
