This article is a part of the series on [**how to build a search bar**](https://appbaseio.gitbooks.io/esc/content/searchbar/introduction.html).

## How to make a normal search bar

This chapter compiles what we learnt so far in the series to implement a searchbar query and UI using Elasticsearch.

The main functionalities that we will need for doing this are:

1. **Auto complete** - While user types, we need to provide auto-completion for the input queries. Auto-complete functionality should be as fast as a user types to provide instant feedback relevant to what a user has already typed in.  Elasticsearch provides a convenient way to get autocomplete up and running quickly with its completion suggester feature.
2. **Suggestions**\(or full text search\) - Use quick suggestions to help users save time, iterate on their searches, and get the results they want. It helps to show the relevant data to user inputs.
3. **UI** - For building the UI, we will use a React components library that provides us the scaffolding for the UI where we can inject the Elasticsearch query.

`Note:` You can deep dive into the implementation details of the above two functionalities through these chapters - [Auto Completion](https://github.com/appbaseio/esc/blob/master/searchbar/auto-complete.md) and [Suggestions](https://github.com/appbaseio/esc/blob/master/searchbar/suggestions.md).

## Defining Mappings

If you have worked with a SQL database system before, you are probably familiar with the idea of a schema. Elasticsearch's equivalent of a schema definition is a mapping.

In this section, we will specify the mappings for our two fields: city and country, with the necessary settings to enable auto-complete and suggestion functionalities.

`auto-suggest` analyzer will be useful to get the suggestions. For the auto completion we will use the `simple` analyzer that tokenizes the text as is \(i.e. no white space splitting\) and applies a lowercase filter.

```json
curl -XPUT $host/normal_searchbar/_settings?pretty -d '{
  "analysis": {
    "tokenizer": {
      "ngramizer": {
        "type": "ngram",
        "min_gram": 1,
        "max_gram": 10,
        "token_chars": [
          "letter",
          "digit",
          "punctuation",
          "symbol"
        ]
      }
  },
    "analyzer": {
      "auto-suggest": {
        "type": "custom",
        "tokenizer": "ngramizer",
        "filter": [
          "lowercase",
          "asciifolding"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}'
```

We just added a custom analyzers. The `_settings` endpoint can be used for adding one or more custom analyzers.

## Defining Mappings

Here we will use two fields and two subfields each of these fields. These subfields are useful to store the same data in a different manner. `city` field is useful to index the cities with the default analyzer of Elasticsearch.

`city_autocomplete` subfield is useful for the auto-completion feature. It indexes and searches the data using `simple` analyzer and with type **completion**.

`city_autocomplete` subfield is useful for the auto-suggestion feature. It indexes the data using `auto-suggest` analyzer, searches the data using `simple` analyzer and is of type **text**.

Similar sub-field structure will also hold true for the country field.

```json
curl -XPUT $host/normal_searchbar/_mapping/searchbar -d '{
  "searchbar": {
    "properties": {
      "city": {
        "type": "text",
        "fields": {
          "city_autocomplete": {
            "type": "completion",
            "analyzer": "simple",
            "search_analyzer": "simple"
          },
          "city_autosuggest": {
            "type": "text",
            "analyzer": "auto-suggest",
            "search_analyzer": "simple"
          }
        }
      },
      "country": {
        "type": "text",
        "fields": {
          "country_autocomplete": {
            "type": "completion",
            "analyzer": "simple",
            "search_analyzer": "simple"
          },
          "country_autosuggest": {
            "type": "text",
            "analyzer": "auto-suggest",
            "search_analyzer": "simple"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}'
```

### Data Indexing

As you can see, while indexing the data, we only need to insert the city and country fields.

```json
curl -XPUT $host/normal_searchbar/searchbar/1 -d '{
  "city": "New York",
  "country": "United States"
}'
```

### Data Browser View

For accessibility, we have indexed ~15,000 data points that can be viewed in the data browser [here. ![](https://i.imgur.com/rHOEixS.png)](https://opensource.appbase.io/dejavu/live/#?input_state=XQAAAALvAAAAAAAAAAA9iIqnY-B2BnTZGEQz6wkFslF8ZMg7A6kGLFGPADbJVmb5ysVqinQQuiFLkb4deUgCDkj3Ca7c1o_y8XA0-MkniaJtriPLcO0sOs-he9RgZSsY1-Dj7M1oUHcSMXEdlL__k05smSCpzBnTIbIxXMyoFoHyy8Z_g-Ku8eQnTdtXdsrQgMg_wmz9OmY-26TdzjLWp-v2Wf1WiRDeMXYvBl1QvLH_j_iLGk7AkFU5rmsqyCR3BmLVt2baZT9KRDsA_8PvEAA&editable=false).

### Query

Next, we will move to the queries section. Here, we will be using the match query for getting the dropdown suggestions and will be using the **completion** suggester query for getting the autocomplete suggestions. Let's first query on the `city` field.

```json
curl "$host/normal_searchbar/searchbar/_search?pretty" -d '{
  "query": {
    "match": {
      "city.city_autosuggest": "New"
    }
  },
  "suggest": {
    "city-suggest": {
      "text": "New",
      "completion": {
        "field": "city.city_autocomplete"
      }
    }
  }
}'
```

##### Response

```json
{
  "took" : 18,
  "timed_out" : false,
  "_shards" : {
    "total" : 1,
    "successful" : 1,
    "failed" : 0
  },
  "hits" : {
    "total" : 2,
    "max_score" : 2.6197505,
    "hits" : [ {
      "_index" : "normal_searchbar",
      "_type" : "searchbar",
      "_id" : "AVsMYRgYhvsk2FETcMug",
      "_score" : 2.6197505,
      "_source" : {
        "city" : "New York",
        "country" : "United States"
      }
    }, {
      "_index" : "normal_searchbar",
      "_type" : "searchbar",
      "_id" : "AVsMYTTkhvsk2FETcNLo",
      "_score" : 2.6197505,
      "_source" : {
        "city" : "New Farm",
        "country" : "Australia"
      }
    }]
  },
  "suggest" : {
    "city-suggest" : [ {
      "text" : "New",
      "offset" : 0,
      "length" : 3,
      "options" : [ {
        "text" : "Newport",
        "score" : 5.0
      }, {
        "text" : "Newmarket",
        "score" : 2.0
      } ]
    } ]
  }
}
```

###### Note: There is some overlap between the autocompletion and autosuggestion feature, here's why we make two separate queries.

| Autocompletion | Autosuggestion |
| :--- | :--- |
| Uses the suggest query and completion mapping type. | Uses the match query with a n-gram based indexing analyzer. |
| Only offers suggestions that match from the beginning of the search query, e.g. "Yor" will return "York" but now "New York". | Offers hits that contains the search query, it doesn't necessarily need to start with the query. e.g. "Yor" may also return "New York" in the matching result. |
| Since autocompletion doesn't tokenize the word, the suggest query here works on words of most practical lengths. | Since we rely on n-grams here, the search's usability is limited to the max token length - 10 in our example. |
| Autocompletion's storage is more efficient because it doesn't breakdown the words into overlapping tokens. | The longer the n-gram token length, the storage requirements increase quadratically. |

#### Query on both City and Country

```json
curl "$host/normal_searchbar/searchbar/_search?pretty" -d '{
  "query": {
     "multi_match": {
        "query": "New",
        "fields": ["city.city_autosuggest", "country.country_autosuggest"]
    }
  },
  "suggest": {
    "city-suggest": {
      "text": "New",
      "completion": {
        "field": "city.city_autocomplete"
      }
    },
    "country-suggest": {
      "text": "New",
      "completion": {
        "field": "country.country_autocomplete"
      }
    }
  }       
}'
```

      } ]
    } ]
  }
}
