### How to build a search bar with Elasticsearch?

This chapter provides a simple introduction and guide to building a search bar for your e-commerce app, user data, or any structured data set that is meant for keyword based queries.

We will use [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch) as our search engine and the index (and dataset) is hosted on an [appbase.io](https://appbase.io) app.
