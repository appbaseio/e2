# Tag wise search: Introduction

### How to build tag wise search with Elasticsearch?

A tag is a label or metadata used on social networks and blogging services which makes it easier for users to find the data with a specific theme or content. Also, it can be useful to filter data according to single or multiple categories.

In this chapter, weâ€™re going to build tag wise search very similar to Github's. We will also show you how to do multiple tag searching and partial tag match.

We will use [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch) as our search engine and the index (and dataset) is hosted on an [appbase.io](https://appbase.io) app.
