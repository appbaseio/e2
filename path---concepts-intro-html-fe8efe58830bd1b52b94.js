A typical successful application would never exceed a throughput of a  few hundred requests per second and generally be okay with serving responses in time.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So much complexity in software comes from trying to make one thing do two things.<br>\n-Ryan Singer</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This quote from Ryan Singer especially sings true when one thinks of scaling database operations. So much of the software service complexities stem from keeping up with the infrastructure needs, that those end up turning into burning pain points. It should come as no surprise that most mainstream distributed systems were born out of the scaling pain points faced by the 0.01% of applications.</p>\n<p>Not only does addressing scale solve the burning pain points faced by the 0.01%, it provides confidence around the edge-cases and leads to faster adoption in production environments and success stories. We hope all of these come true for SCALR. In building SCALR, focusing on scale has lead us to a better foundational design, a more rigorously tested codebase, and a fine-grained monitoring of our deployment infrastructure. We’ll go more in depth about these learnings over the next few months, but most importantly - for the 99.9% folks reading this, <code>SCALR</code> has tons of improvements and features over <code>v2</code>.</p>\n<h1 id="api-intro"><a href="#api-intro" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>API Intro</h1>\n<p>Welcome to the land of SCALR, where everyone smiles and the sun shines bright.</p>\n<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/3nYaIQM.png?1" alt="SCALR banner image"></p>\n<p>Our beloved Hobo Lobo is chalking a ‘SCALR’ 101.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>“changes what?”, asks someone.<br>\n“Everything”, says Hobo Lobo rather curtly.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id="scalr---whats-in-a-name"><a href="#scalr---whats-in-a-name" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a><code>SCALR</code> - What’s in a name</h2>\n<p>The most tangible change is in the codename - <code>scalr</code>. Breaking the convention of keeping a dull version name like <code>v2.0</code>, we will go with the version <code>scalr</code>. Docs for scalr are available at <a href="">https://docs.appbase.io/</a> and the API base URL would be <code>https://scalr.api.appbase.io</code>.</p>\n<h3 id="compatible-with-elasticsearch"><a href="#compatible-with-elasticsearch" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Compatible with ElasticSearch</h3>\n<p><code>scalr</code> is compatible out of the box with v2.4 ElasticSearch API.

Instead of being a websockets based extension of the API to track just the document and reference changes, data streams are deeply baked into the <code>SCALR</code> API. Data Streams are implemented over both <strong>websockets</strong> (for browsers) and <strong>http-streaming</strong> (for other runtimes) and are pervasive over web, mobile and language native libraries. Data Streams can stream results of queries and filters as new data is indexed into an app.</p>\n<h3 id="http-basic-authentication"><a href="#http-basic-authentication" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>HTTP Basic Authentication</h3>\n<p><code>scalr</code> uses HTTP Basic Authentication for securing app access (similar to Github and Wordpress’s authentication mechanisms).

Most ElasticSearch libraries support HTTP Basic Auth already, a major compatibility win.</p>\n<p>What’s more, multiple appbase.io Basic Auth credentials can be generated per app with (read, write) controllable permissions.</p>\n<h3 id="zero-ops"><a href="#zero-ops" aria-hidden="true" class="anchor"><svg aria-hidden="true" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a>Zero Ops</h3>\n<p>The APIs related to devops, like clusters, multi-index operations, index creation are not a part of Appbase.io.
