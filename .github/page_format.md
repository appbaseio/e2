# Idea

One page per example. Each example covers a use-case in detail, and examples that fall under the same broad use-case can be categorized into a chapter. Optionally, a chapter can be a part of a course. But it all starts with pages!

# Page Sections Format:

Each page will have sections in the following order. The goal is to keep the explanations at a minimal level and focus on the code and examples. Side notes can be added using informative, danger zone or bookmark icons.

## Use-case

## Mapping

## Data Indexing

## Data Browser View
